monkey,"Chimpanzee cultures are disappearing. In places where their habitats have been heavily altered by humans, groups are abandoning unique behaviours and reverting to a core set of activities. The loss of chimpanzee cultural diversity is analogous to the way many human languages are disappearing because so few people speak them. It could make life more difficult for chimps in the long run, because many of the lost behaviours allow the chimps to obtain additional food. Chimpanzee culture refers to how groups have different behavioural traditions, which are passed on by learning and imitation rather than genes.
                     
 For example, some chimps in Uganda have learned to use moss to soak up water, which they can then drink. Chimps elsewhere don’t do this. In 2002, Carel van Schaik at the University of Zurich in Switzerland suggested that human interference could destroy this cultural diversity. Now a decade-long study has found strong evidence that van Schaik was right. A team co-led by Hjalmar Kühl at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig, Germany, tracked 31 cultural behaviours, such as using twigs to catch termites, in 144 chimpanzee communities across Africa. They used camera traps to record behaviours, scouted for the remains of tools, and studied faeces to see if the chimps had eaten things like termites that can be obtained only by using tools. The team then placed the different communities on a map and overlaid a measure of human disturbance, which combined factors like the density of the human population and the amount of infrastructure. They found that, in areas with a greater human footprint, the chimps perform fewer cultural behaviours. Each behaviour was 88 per cent less likely to occur in these human-dominated landscapes. “In those places, we find the chimpanzees have suffered a loss in behavioural or cultural diversity,” says study co-leader Ammie Kalan at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig. “This is a very impressive study, with sample sizes that were unimaginable just a few years ago and very careful analyses that controlled for all the obvious confounds,” says van Schaik. “It is a discouraging finding,” says Jill Pruetz at Texas State University. “Those of us who work in disturbed areas kind of had these thoughts before, but to see it demonstrated like that is especially significant.” Losing some of the behaviours poses a real risk to the chimps, says Pruetz, because if they stop fishing for termites or cracking nuts, they lose access to those foods. Conservationists must now ensure that, as well as keeping animal populations up, they also preserve behavioural diversity, says Kühl. He says living near humans need not be disastrous. In a study published in February, he and his colleagues showed that chimps living in human-modified landscapes can do fine provided people don’t actively harm them, such as by hunting them for meat. Chimps in these areas may ultimately invent new behaviours to suit their altered homes. Another crucial step will be to create corridors so that chimps can move from one group to another. “The community I study is cut off on both sides,” says Pruetz. “The fact you don’t have the exchange of individuals leads not only to a lack of genetic diversity but also a lack of behavioural diversity.” Other species with culture may also be losing cultural diversity. “This is not just specific to chimpanzees,” says Kühl. Other primates like orangutans and capuchin monkeys are obvious examples, as are cetaceans like whales, dolphins and orcas. More on these topics: "
monkey,"One group of monkeys is going through an unexpected transition – their coats are changing rapidly from charcoal black to creamy yellow. Hair colour in primates is controlled by melanin. It comes in two forms: eumelanin, which is responsible for brown and black hues, and pheomelanin, which produces yellow and red tones. The mix of melanin in an animal’s skin and hair is determined by DNA, so the natural hair colour of individuals belonging to the same species should remain relatively fixed.

monkey,"About 11 million years ago, monkeys somehow crossed the sea from South America to the island of Jamaica in the Caribbean. There they evolved into a new species that was unlike any other known monkey. It’s a striking example of how living on an island can transform a species. The details have been revealed by preserved DNA. The first remains of Xenothrix mcgregori were discovered in Long Mile Cave, Jamaica in 1920. The few bones found reveal a highly unusual monkey, with relatively few teeth and leg bones similar to those of a rodent. “What they suggest is a very slow-moving, perhaps even sloth-like lifestyle, which is perhaps not unexpected in an animal living on an island with few predators other than large birds,” says Ross MacPhee of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Some extinct Madagascan lemurs also evolved a similar slow-moving lifestyle.
                     
 Ever since it was described in 1952, X. mcgregori has been an enigma. It was related to South American monkeys, but it was unclear which group it belonged to or when its ancestors reached Jamaica. Several suggestions had been made based on the bones, but the monkey was so unusual it was impossible to be sure. “It’s been all over the place,” says MacPhee. To clear up the mystery, MacPhee and his colleagues obtained DNA from two preserved X. mcgregori bones. They recovered the entire mitochondrial genome – which animals only inherit from their mothers – and seven chunks of the nuclear genome. The team compared these samples of DNA with the equivalent sequences from 15 different groups of South American primate. They found that X. mcgregori belonged to a group called the titi monkeys. These monkeys live in forests, eat fruit and do not have prehensile tails. X. mcgregori does not look like a typical titi monkey, though, so arriving on the island evidently forced its ancestors to evolve. “The selective pressures on them must have been just extreme,” says MacPhee. “It looks like it got thrown into the mixer.” Island species often evolve rapidly, because there are few large predators but also little fresh water. Xenothrix split from its closest South American relatives roughly 11 million years ago, suggesting that is when its ancestors reached Jamaica. They must have somehow crossed the sea, perhaps on a raft of vegetation. Other primates were present in the Caribbean rather earlier, from about 18 million years ago. It seems several groups made the crossing at the different times, establishing a unique ecosystem. Unfortunately, most of the Caribbean’s native species died out when humans first arrived on the islands, so are only known from preserved remains. X. mcgregori died out about 900 years ago. There is no hard evidence as to why. “What we think but cannot demonstrate is that Xenothrix, like hundreds of other species, was a victim of either direct or indirect impacts by the first humans who got there,” says MacPhee.

monkey,"Monkeys become more relaxed if they simply watch one monkey grooming another. “If you walk down a street and see someone being nice to someone else, it gives you a warm feeling inside,” says Stuart Semple of the University of Roehampton in London, UK. It seems monkeys experience the same thing. With his student Juliette Berthier, Semple studied 20 female Barbary macaques living in a semi-free ranging group in a Safari park-like environment in a UK forest.
                     
 When a macaque saw another being groomed, the observer started performing fewer “self-directed” behaviours such as scratching and yawning. These behaviours are thought to be signs of anxiety, so it seems the observer macaques became less anxious after seeing another macaque being groomed. “Merely watching grooming is in itself relaxing for monkeys,” says Semple. The observer macaques also became more likely to participate in grooming themselves, either as groomer or groomee. Furthermore, they displayed more friendly behaviours in general, such as cuddling other macaques or feeding with them. The phenomenon is similar to “emotional contagion”: humans become more cheerful if we meet someone cheerful, even online, and some parrots start playing when they hear other parrots making playful sounds. But in this case the effect lasted longer, in some cases 30 minutes. The finding may help explain the phenomenon of “ASMR” (autonomous sensory meridian response). Some people experience a pleasant, calming tingle when watching videos of other people whispering or performing actions like tapping their fingers on surfaces. “If you look at what sorts of behaviours tend to trigger ASMR in people, they’re basically grooming,” says Nick Davis of Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK. For instance, ASMR videos often include comforting gestures and gentle speech. “The change in behaviour that we see in those animals seems to be similar to what we see in humans,” says Davis. “There’s a calming effect.” He wants to see studies of the physiological changes in the macaques, to see if they are similar to those seen in humans experiencing ASMR. Semple agrees that there is an “interesting parallel” and speculates that videos in which one person is kind to another might also trigger ASMR.   More on these topics: "
monkey,"When bonobos give birth, other females gather around to support and protect the mother. These “midwives” bely the notion that assistance during birth is unique to humans. Until now there has only been one scientific account of a wild bonobo giving birth, published in 2014. On that occasion, other females stayed close to the mother. Now Elisa Demuru of the University of Pisa in Italy and her colleagues have described three births among captive bonobos at primate parks in France and the Netherlands.

monkey,"Humans and chimpanzees might have one more thing in common: they both seem to have benefitted from sex with a closely related species. During the last decade, geneticists have reported that our species interbred with ancient humans including the Neanderthals and Denisovans. They have also found tantalising signs that we benefitted from doing so, gaining DNA that may have boosted our immune systems or made us better able to survive at high altitude or in the frigid Arctic. …"
monkey,"A CASHEW is a tough nut to crack. You must carefully balance it on an anvil and bash it with a hammer, while avoiding contact with the caustic resin in its shell. This takes great skill. Yet bearded capuchin monkeys living in north-east Brazil take it in their stride. And their tool-wielding talents don’t end there. They also dig for tubers and insects with rocks. Females sometimes even hurl them at males in what appears to be an unusual flirting tactic. We used to think that using tools was the preserve of our hominin lineage and one of the remarkable talents that made us human. So much for that idea… In fact, we have known for some years that our closest living relatives, chimps, employ a variety of tools, including some made of stone. Recently, primatologists have been intrigued to discover that this also applies to two more-distant cousins – the capuchins and macaques living in a coastal region of Thailand. The findings have attracted the attention of archaeologists keen to explore the so-called Stone Ages of non-human primates. Digging through layers of dirt, they have already unearthed the remains of tools made thousands of years ago. Their discoveries usher in the new discipline of primate archaeology, which has the potential to give novel insights not just about these species but also about our distant ancestors. Before, it was assumed that we alone possessed an archaeological record containing material evidence of past behaviours. Now that three more such records are emerging, it is possible to …"
monkey," STUFFED and displayed in an Edinburgh museum, Dolly the sheep seems a distant memory – like the technique used to create her more than 20 years ago. But with the news that Chinese researchers have cloned two macaques (see “Scientists have cloned monkeys and it could help treat cancer”), Dolly suddenly feels relevant again. The long-awaited success revives not just memories of the sheep herself, but also the moral panic that greeted her. The fear then was that we had opened a Pandora’s box of cloned humans. Cloning primates seemingly brings that prospect even closer.
                     
 It didn’t happen then and it probably won’t now. If anything, the breakthrough confirms what we already knew: that cloning humans from adult cells remains a formidable technical challenge. The macaques were created from fetal cells, not adult ones. Nonetheless, there are still ethical implications. The Chinese team says its aim is to better understand harrowing human diseases. For that there is a good scientific rationale to the clones. Macaques are a better human analogue than mice, and cloning gives a level of precision that conventional breeding cannot. But is there a moral case too? Generating meaningful results would require cloning and experimentation on a massive scale. Team leader Mu-ming Poo of the Shanghai Institute of Neuroscience is on record as saying he thinks primate research is worth it – as long as appropriate ethical standards are applied. In reality, however, the creation of clones doesn’t alter the ethical equation. The procedure is still inefficient and legions of cloned macaques appear unlikely; meanwhile, China has embarked on a major research programme using conventionally bred and GM primates. The ethical debate is very much alive, but clones are not where the action is – at least for now. This article appeared in print under the headline “More monkey business” More on these topics: "
monkey,"MEET Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, the world’s first monkeys cloned using the technique that gave us Dolly the sheep. The female long-tailed macaques represent a technical milestone. It should make it possible to create customisable and genetically uniform populations of monkeys, which could speed up treatments for diseases such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and cancer. But the breakthrough will inevitably raise fears that human cloning is closer than ever. The monkeys hold such huge potential because they all inherit exactly the same genetic material, says the Chinese team that cloned them.
                     
 This would enable scientists to tweak genes the monkeys have that are linked to human disease, and then monitor how this alters the animals’ biology, comparing it against animals that are genetically identical except for the alterations. It could accelerate the hunt for genes and processes that go wrong in these diseases, and ways to correct them, the team says. Although 23 species of mammal have been cloned since Dolly – including pigs, cats, dogs, rats and cattle – monkeys have, until now, proved resistant to the technique (see “A brief history of mammal cloning”).  In 2000, researchers cloned monkeys for the first time, but did so by splitting an embryo after it had been fertilised, essentially just producing a genetically identical twin. This method can only be used to create a maximum of four identical animals. Now, Qiang Sun at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai and his colleagues have tweaked the technique used to produce Dolly to create a theoretically limitless number of clones. Called somatic cell nuclear transfer, the method involves removing the nucleus from a donor egg cell and replacing it with one taken out of a cell from another animal. An electric current is used to trick the egg into thinking it has been fertilised, and it starts to develop into an early embryo. When implanted into the uterus of a surrogate mother, the embryo will grow into a carbon copy of the animal that donated the nucleus (see diagram). Previous attempts to do this in monkeys have never progressed beyond an early embryonic stage called a blastocyst. Sun and his colleagues went further by introducing two new ingredients to the soup of nutrients and growth factors that help cloned embryos grow before being placed into the surrogate. The ingredients – messenger RNA and a compound called trichostatin A – awakened at least 2000 genes that are vital for various stages of embryonic development, enabling development to proceed.  The team also discovered that it is easier to clone macaques if you use cells from fetal macaques rather than adults. Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua were both created using cells destined to form connective tissue, extracted from an aborted female fetus. Altogether, 79 embryos were implanted into 21 surrogates. The pair were the only live births from six pregnancies (Cell, DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2018.01.020). Dolly was the only success from 277 implanted embryos.  Although attempts to perform the technique using cells taken from adult macaques also produced two live animals, both died soon after birth, and one had abnormal body development. “For many cell types, reprogramming is more difficult for adult cells than for fetal cells,” says Robert Lanza, chief scientist at the Astellas Institute for Regenerative Medicine in Massachusetts, whose team cloned human adult skin cells for the first time in 2014. “That appears to be the case here as well,” he says. This technical hurdle may put to rest fears often expressed after cloning successes: that it could lead to a Never Let Me Go scenario – the science fiction novel in which human clones are created for spare organs. Post-Dolly, the Raëlian movement in California claimed it had cloned human babies. It set up a firm called Clonaid but its efforts were dismissed as a hoax. “It could be a step towards human cloning, but why would you do it?” says Peter Andrews at the University of Sheffield, UK. “In terms of human biology, it’s illegal to clone a human in Britain and many other countries, and I don’t think anyone would rationally want to do it.” The Chinese team says its focus is to use the cloned monkeys to create better animal models of disease in order to accelerate medical therapies. Andrews says this concept has merit, especially given the long-standing difficulties of trying to mimic complex diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s in mice. To date, all therapies that have treated Alzheimer’s-like symptoms in mice have failed when trialled in humans. One potential reason for the repeated failure is that the Alzheimer’s mouse model is not a close enough replica of the human version of the disease. Now it might be possible to better model Alzheimer’s in cloned monkeys by knocking out genes that have a similar role in monkeys and humans, such as one that triggers the production of beta-amyloid plaques that clog up Alzheimer’s brains. There are issues though, says Andrews. “Not least the cost of keeping primates, and that you’d need to breed many of them for it to be useful. You would then run into ethical problems – you can see why people would object.” The most recent UK assessment on the ethics of primate research, published in 2006, found “a strong scientific case for the carefully regulated use of non-human primates where there are no other means to address clearly defined questions of particular importance”. In 2013, the US announced plans to retire all but 50 of its 360 research chimpanzees and phase out the majority of research on these animals that it previously supported. It is also reviewing its policies on other related animals. In contrast, China plans to accelerate medical therapies by studying cloned and genetically engineered monkeys. At a conference in May 2016, Mu-ming Poo of the Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai unveiled the world’s first genetically engineered monkey with a version of Parkinson’s disease and presented ambitious plans to expand the use of monkeys to study neurodegenerative disease. He made the same case in New Scientist shortly after, arguing that because monkeys are so closely related to us and have advanced minds and complex social networks, they will tell us much more about diseases of the brain than mice ever could.  1996 Dolly the sheep is born using a technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer, in which the DNA from one animal is placed into an empty donor egg. The two components are stimulated with an electric current and given nutrients that stimulate them to grow into an embryo. 2000 First monkey cloned, but not using the Dolly technique. Instead, a monkey embryo is split to create more embryos. This method can only be used to create a maximum of four clones. 2001 The first attempt at using cloning to boost an endangered species fails after a cloned bison called Noah dies soon after birth. 2001 The first cloned cat arrives, called “Cc”, short for “carbon copy”. 2004 The first cloned monkey embryos are created using the Dolly technique, but none survive long enough to be implanted. 2004 South Korean scientist, Woo Suk Hwang, claims to have obtained embryonic stem cells from cloned human embryos. 2005 Snuppy, the world’s first cloned dog is unveiled, also by Woo Suk Hwang. 2006 Woo Suk Hwang’s claims of cloning human embryos are found to have been fraudulent. 2013 Embryonic stem cells are extracted from cloned human embryos by Shoukhrat Mitalipov at the Oregon Regional Primate Research Center. 2016 Mu-ming Poo at the Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai, China, unveils the world’s first genetically engineered monkey with a version of Parkinson’s disease. 2018 The world’s first cloned monkeys using the Dolly technique are unveiled in China.

monkey," A rare sighting of a chimpanzee giving birth in the wild came to a grisly conclusion. Within seconds of the birth, the baby was snatched away and eaten by a male of the same group. The observation explains why female chimpanzees tend to go into hiding for weeks or months when they have their babies. Little is known about how chimpanzees give birth in the wild because only five births have ever been observed, says Hitonaru Nishie of Kyoto University in Japan. Nishie and his colleagues have been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania’s Mahale mountains for the last few years.
                     
 One of the reasons so few have been witnessed is that the soon-to-be mothers often leave the group when the baby is due, and don’t return until the infant is weeks or months old. This absence has been described as a chimpanzee’s “maternity leave”. So Nishie and his colleague Michio Nakamura were surprised when, at around 11 am one December day, a female member of the chimpanzee group they were observing began to give birth in front of the 20 other members. As soon as the baby was out – and before the mother had even had a chance to touch it – the baby was snatched away by a male member of the group, who then disappeared into the bush. The researchers found him around 1½ hours later, sitting up a tree and eating the infant from the lower half of its body. He ate the entire body within an hour. This is the first time anyone has reported seeing a newborn chimpanzee cannibalised in this way, says Nishie. He says that his observation provides an obvious clue as to why chimpanzee mothers tend to hide away to give birth. In this case, the mother may not yet have had a chance to learn about “maternity leave” if it was her first pregnancy, says Tatyana Humle at the University of Kent, UK. “I would predict that she would go on ‘maternity leave’ next time,” she says. In fact, when the female chimp did subsequently have another baby (pictured above), she disappeared for a month. Male animals of many other species are known to kill young infants that aren’t related to them. This allows them to mate with the mother, and to have more of their own offspring in the group. And female chimpanzees have also been spotted killing the infants of other females when resources like food are scarce, says Humle. The baby chimp may simply have been a source of nutrition to the adult that snatched it, says Nishie. At any rate, infanticide and cannabilism are extremely rare among chimpanzees, says Hulme. “I work with a chimp community in West Africa, and I have never witnessed any cases,” she says. Humle thinks that such violence may be more likely to occur in larger groups, where there is more competition for resources. More on these topics: "
monkey,"Monkeys living on an island have learned to use a startling variety of tools and techniques to obtain the juicy innards of different foods – and to floss their teeth afterwards. The Nicobar long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis umbrosus) is only found on three islands in the eastern Indian Ocean. One of them is Great Nicobar Island. To find out about the macaques’ eating habits, Honnavalli Kumara at the Sálim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History in Coimbatore, India, and colleagues followed 20 around a small coastal village on the island.
                     
 Many of the macaques’ favoured foods are thorny, slimy, hairy or mucky. To get rid of these inedible coatings, the macaques either wash the foods in puddles or wrap them in leaves and rub them clean. They also wrap leaves around certain foods to make them easier to hold. Trash like paper, cloth or plastic is also used for wrapping and wiping foods. The macaques eat coconuts too, plucking them from the tree by twisting them around or using their teeth to cut them off. If it is tender, the macaques de-husk the coconut using their teeth, holding it down with their feet and hands, in order to get to the water and juicy bits inside. If the coconut is ripe, however, they also have to crack its shell. To do so, they take it to a hard surface like a rock or concrete, and pound it. It’s not just tool use. The macaques were seen beating bushes with their hands to disturb insects hiding within, catching those that fly out or drop to the ground. After eating, adult and sub-adult macaques clean their teeth – they were seen holding a fine fibre between their teeth and pulling at it. The macaques used a range of materials as dental floss: a tree needle, a bird feather, a blade of grass, a coconut fibre, a nylon thread and a metal wire. Some modify the threads before use, for instance by tearing them apart. Nine of the 20 macaques were seen “flossing”. They did so after eating various foods in different habitats, says Kumara. The Nicobar long-tailed macaques are the third monkeys seen flossing their teeth. Japanese macaques use their own fur, while Thailand’s long-tailed macaques use human hair. “Wrapping irritating items, cleaning by rubbing, and flossing teeth with thin fibres have been described in other populations of macaques,” says primatologist Dorothy Fragaszy at the University of Georgia, Athens. “The newest element, to me, is ‘bush-beating’ to flush insect prey.” Macaques adapt well to human-dominated landscapes, where they tend to manipulate objects more, says primatologist Michael Gumert at the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. “They are the king of generalists… about as adaptable as we are.” Tool use on its own doesn’t take much intelligence, says Gumert. “However, the modification of tools does show planning and foresight – something that someone who has ever observed macaques in any detail would never have doubted.” More on these topics: "
monkey,"If you’re trying to overthrow the boss, you might need a friend to back you up. The same is true for female macaques, who need allies to resist authority and take down more powerful members of the group. Most primates have social hierarchies in which some individuals are dominant over the others. For rhesus macaques, these strict hierarchies are organised around female relationships. Lower-ranked females have little social mobility and must silently bare their teeth to higher-ranked females. The signal means “I want you to know that I know that you out-rank me” and is important in communicating social rank, says Darcy Hannibal at the University of California, Davis. “They are ‘bending the knee’.”
                     
 But Hannibal and her colleagues have discovered that subordinate females can override the status quo. To do this, female macaques form alliances with family, friends or both. These alliances help females maintain or increase their social rank and compete for resources. A female who wants to challenge those higher up needs this help, says Hannibal. To find out what factors affect the rate of insubordination, the team studied 357 captive adult females, who experienced almost 11,000 conflicts. Insubordination events were more likely if the lower-ranked female was older. They were most likely if the subordinate outweighed the dominant female by 7 kilograms and the dominant female had no family allies. The more allies the subordinate female had, and the more days her mother was present in the group, the more often she would exhibit insubordinate behaviour. While having the support of friends and family was critical for a subordinate female to rebel, the number of friends didn’t matter for dominant females. “It may be that simply holding the dominant position provides a sort of ‘possession’ advantage,” says Hannibal. However, Dario Maestripieri at the University of Chicago, Illinois says the team found an awful lot of insubordination in a two-year period. He says their definition of the term might be too broad and that they have lumped a lot of distinct behaviours together. Maestripieri says true insubordination is calculated aggression with the goal of changing one’s status. Such overthrow events – where entire families revolt against their superiors with the intent to kill – are rare. Read more: Social networks: Getting connected More on these topics: "
monkey,"There, there! Adult chimpanzees are less likely than younger ones to console their companions in times of distress. The finding raises questions about how the capacity for empathy changes with age in our closest relatives – and us. When a chimpanzee gets upset, perhaps after losing a fight, companions will often sit with them and provide reassurance by kissing, grooming or embracing them. The same is true of young children. By age 2, children typically respond to a family member crying by consoling them in a similar way.
                     
 We know chimpanzees have personalities: individual differences in their behaviour that are consistent over time. But it was unclear whether their empathetic tendencies are part of their personality, and whether they change over time. Christine Webb at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and her colleagues wanted to find out. The team studied eight years of observations of a group of 44 chimpanzees at Yerkes National Primate Research Center, also in Georgia. They found that individual differences were consistent over their lifespan: chimps who consoled more in their youth, relative to their peers, also consoled more than their peers later in life. This is the first evidence that chimps have “empathetic personalities”, says Webb. But they also found that juvenile chimpanzees console others more than adults, and infants console most of all age groups. This doesn’t mean that older chimps have less empathy than younger ones, says co-author Frans de Waal, also of Emory University. “I think they become more selective in how they express it,” he says. “They focus on individuals they’re close to – offspring or friends – whereas the young ones respond to everything emotional.” A similar pattern has been reported in bonobos and gorillas. In contrast, humans become more empathetic through childhood and adolescence. There is evidence that empathy continues to increase until middle age, and then declines, but it comes from questionnaires in which people report their own behaviour. “I don’t trust them,” says de Waal. Mariska Kret of Leiden University in the Netherlands agrees that those studies may be questionable. It would be better to test consolation behaviour in adults and children. “It may be that older individuals console less, but when they do, they do better,” she says. Webb and de Waal suggest another possible explanation for the finding. They point to previous studies on two personality traits: agreeableness, which involves a sensitivity towards others; and extraversion, a tendency to actively engage with others. In humans and chimpanzees, agreeableness increases with age but extraversion decreases more substantially. The changes in consolation behaviour might simply reflect the latter trend. A 2013 study of humans measured volunteers’ brain activity while they watched videos of people getting hurt. Older people had weaker emotional responses to the videos, but they processed intentionality – whether or not someone had inflicted pain on purpose – in a similar way. The researchers suggested older people can understand others’ feelings without becoming emotionally distressed, which might improve their own wellbeing.

monkey," We may not be alone in our struggle against Alzheimer’s disease. For the first time, the plaques and tangles that characterise the condition have been found in the brains of elderly chimpanzees, although it is unclear if they cause dementia in the animals. In the brains of people with Alzheimer’s, a protein called beta-amyloid accumulates and forms sticky plaques between brain cells. These plaques trigger changes in another protein called tau, causing it to form tangles. Together, these plaques and tangles are thought to kill brain cells, leading to dementia.
                     
 It is difficult to study the disease and develop treatments for it because other species seem not to develop plaques and tangles. The only time they’ve both been seen in another animal’s brain was in a 41-year-old chimpanzee, but they were thought to be the result of a stroke. But Melissa Edler, now at Northeast Ohio Medical University, and her colleagues have had the rare chance to study 20 brains from older chimpanzees, aged between 37 and 62. The team examined four areas of the chimps’ neocortex and hippocampus – brain regions most commonly affected by Alzheimer’s in humans. They discovered beta-amyloid plaques and early forms of tau tangles coexisting in 12 of the chimp brains and, as in humans, they saw increasingly larger volumes of plaques in the chimp brains of more advanced age (Neurobiology of Aging, DOI: 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2017.07.006). It is not clear whether these plaques and tangles lead to the same kind of cognitive decline in chimps that we experience. “Our samples had been collected over decades, without any consistent or rigorous cognitive data accompanying them,” says Mary Ann Raghanti of Kent State University, Ohio, in whose lab the work was performed. “So it wasn’t possible to say whether the chimps had devastating cognitive loss or not.” However, so far, there are no examples of chimps with Alzheimer’s-like dementia. “I’m cautious to say that they don’t get this kind of devastating decline, but we haven’t seen it yet,” says Raghanti. This study contributes to growing evidence that the classic plaques and tangles of Alzheimer’s disease may be by-products rather than the cause of the disease, says Gary Kennedy, director of the Division of Geriatric Psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. “That great apes demonstrate the pathology but not the precipitous decline of dementia reinforces this notion.” Humans may have something unique about their brain that predisposes us to the cognitive decline that accompanies plaques and tangles, says Raghanti. “If we can identify those differences between the human and chimp brain then we might be able to pinpoint what is mediating the degeneration. That could be a target for drug treatment.” This article will appear in print under the headline “Chimps show signs of Alzheimer’s” More on these topics: "
monkey,"Six years ago, a chimpanzee had the bright idea to use moss to soak up water, then drink from it, and seven others soon learned the trick. Three years later, researchers returned to the site to see if the practice had persisted to become part of the local chimp culture. They now report that the technique has continued to spread, and it’s mostly been learned by relatives of the original moss-spongers. This adds to earlier evidence that family ties are the most important routes for culture to spread in animals. After the first report of chimps using moss as a sponge in Budongo Forest, Uganda, researchers rarely saw the behaviour again, and wondered whether chimps still knew how to do it. So they set up an experiment, providing moss and leaves at the clay pit where the chimps had demonstrated the technique before.
                     
 Then they watched to see whether chimpanzees would use leaves – a more common behaviour – or moss to soak up the mineral-rich water from the pit. Most of the original moss-spongers used moss again during the experiment, and so did another 17 chimps, showing the practice had become more widespread. The researchers wondered what factors influenced which individuals adopted it: were they connected socially, or through families, for instance? This group of chimps has been observed for a long time, so the researchers were able to look through field data to calculate an index of how much time each chimpanzee spent with other individuals. It turned out that this metric wasn’t a good predictor of which chimps would use the moss sponge. Instead, moss-sponging was strongly correlated with having moss-sponging relatives. The chimpanzees didn’t only learn from their parents: it was spread between any family members in either direction. “It’s like the family is the [crucible] where the behaviour is transmitted,” says Thibaud Gruber of the University of Geneva, Switzerland, one of the study authors. But there were also individuals who learned the technique from non-family members. “Once a behaviour has been developed and spread to a few individuals, the majority of transmission will appear in the family, but if you hang out with some tool users, you’re still likely to develop a behaviour by social learning,” says Gruber. “This is a wonderful contribution to the study of animal cultures,” says Andrew Whiten at the University of St Andrews, UK. “The accumulated evidence suggests that chimpanzees pass on scores of different traditions across Africa, but being able to see any of them originate and then spread is very much rarer.” One of few previous studies to record new behaviours emerging and spreading in animal populations involved Japanese macaques on Koshima Island in the 1950s. A young female began washing sand off sweet potatoes in a river before eating them, and her peers soon did the same. Since then, the behaviour has spread from mother to offspring. Moss-sponging seems to be following a similar pattern, says Frans de Waal of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. “Social closeness is most of the time a bias in social learning, so that individuals learn the best from those they hang out with and whose behaviour interests them,” he says. We learn more readily from those we can identify with, and so do animals, he adds. The origins of human culture may lie in the sharing of useful behaviours this way, says Whiten. “What has been revealed in recent studies of cultural practices in all the great apes – chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans – means it would be surprising if humans’ ape ancestors did not show similar behaviour, the foundations of the rich human cultures that have evolved in more recent times.” However, some researchers think moss-sponging chimpanzees and potato-washing macaques aren’t learning by imitation at all, and each one invents the behaviour by itself. “Chimpanzees fail to imitate in controlled experiments, and moss sponging does indeed occur in naive individuals,” says Claudio Tennie at the University of Tübingen, Germany. “Neither this nor the potato washing study – or indeed any other study – shows similar cultures in chimpanzees to our own.” Gruber takes a different point of view. “Chimps are able, to a certain extent, to imitate, although it may not be as fine grained as in humans,” he says.

monkey,"Being too friendly can be costly. When a new alpha male takes over, female capuchin monkeys are more likely to lose their offspring to infanticide if they have an extensive network of social contacts than if they don’t. This new finding suggests sociable primates don’t necessarily fare better than non-sociable ones when it comes to raising offspring. Group-living mammals have plenty to gain from being sociable, says Urs Kalbitzer at the University of Calgary in Canada. They can have better access to food and more protection from predators, as they often take up a position near the centre of the group. These advantages should help the most sociable females raise more infants to adulthood.
                     
 But some researchers have suspected that being sociable carries a cost when the group’s alpha male loses his position to a rival. The usurper can kill offspring he hasn’t fathered so that adult females will become receptive to his sexual advances. One idea is that the alpha male is more likely to kill the offspring of females at the group’s social core, as less sociable females on the periphery may escape his attention. To test the theory, a team led by Kalbitzer and his colleague Linda Fedigan looked at data from wild communities of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) in Santa Rosa, Costa Rica, between 2005 and 2011. They found that an infant was, on average, more likely to survive during times of group stability if its mother was sociable. But when the alpha male’s position was threatened or if he was replaced – which happened roughly once every four years – infants born to sociable females were more at risk of infanticide. Overall, the team found that a female’s level of sociability had no significant effect on the number of offspring she successfully raised over the course of her lifetime. In other words, the advantages of sociability seem to be counterbalanced by the price she pays during alpha male changeovers. Surprisingly, there was no evidence that females changed how sociable they were at different times, even though becoming less sociable when the alpha male was threatened might reduce the risk of infanticide. “Females with strong bonds may not opt out of their spatially central position in times of increased infanticide risk because peripheral positions are associated with increased predation risk,” says Oliver Schülke at the University of Göttingen, Germany. “It will be interesting to see whether, with more data accumulating, highly social females turn out to enjoy longer lives.” There might be lessons from such studies for understanding human social networks too, says Kalbitzer. “They can reveal which features of social relationships are relatively ancient, and which selection pressures may have acted on our ancestors.” This article appeared in print under the headline “Friendly monkeys lose in rough times” More on these topics: "
monkey,"It was a gruesome scene. The body had severe wounds and was still bleeding despite having been lying for a few hours in the hot Senegalese savanna. The murder victim, a West African chimpanzee called Foudouko, had been beaten with rocks and sticks, stomped on and then cannibalised by his own community. This is one of just nine known cases where a group of chimpanzees has killed one of their own adult males, as opposed to killing a member of a neighbouring tribe.
                     
 These intragroup killings are rare, but Michael Wilson at the University of Minnesota says they are a valuable insight into chimp behaviour such as male coalition building. “Why do these coalitions sometimes succeed, but not very often? It’s at the heart of this tension between conflict and cooperation, which is central to the lives of chimpanzees and even to our own,” he says. Chimps usually live in groups with more adult females than males, but in the group with the murder it was the other way round. “When you reverse that and have almost two males per every female — that really intensifies the competition for reproduction. That seems to be a key factor here,” says Wilson. Jill Pruetz at Iowa State University, who has been studying this group of chimpanzees in south-eastern Senegal since 2001, agrees. She suggests that human influence may have caused this skewed gender ratio that is likely to have been behind this attack. In Senegal, female chimpanzees are poached to provide infants for the pet trade. Thirteen years ago, Foudouko reigned over one of the chimp clans at the Fongoli study site, part of the Fongoli Savanna Chimpanzee Project. As alpha male, he was “somewhat of a tyrant”, Pruetz says. Foudouko gained alpha status in his late teens and ruled alongside his right-hand chimp, Mamadou, the group’s beta male. In 2007, Mamadou was severely injured and separated from the group for weeks, returning frail and holding a lower rank in the social hierarchy. Because Foudouko maintained an alliance with his now-weak partner, he was ostracised and then ousted by the others. He lived alone on the outskirts of chimp society for years, only being observed by researchers in the field once or twice a year. Chimpanzee groups at Fongoli are fairly isolated, so Foudouko’s only chance of finding a mate was to rejoin the group. By 2013, Mamadou had regained beta male status and his brother, David, had taken over as alpha. They accepted Foudouko back into the fold, although other members of the group still chased him off periodically. “We just happened to have at the time five young males all coming up in the hierarchy and those guys together didn’t want to let Foudouko back in,” says Pruetz. “He was trying to come back in at a high rank, which was ultimately a foolish thing to do on his part.” Early one morning, Pruetz and her team heard loud screams and hoots from the chimps’ nearby sleep nest. At dawn, they found Foudouko dead, bleeding profusely from a bite to his right foot. He also had a large gash in his back and a ripped anus. Later he was found to have cracked ribs. Pruetz says Foudouko probably died of internal injuries or bled out from his foot wound. Foudouko also had wounds on his fingers. These were likely to have been caused by chimps clamping them in their teeth to stretch his arms out and hold him down during the attack, says Pruetz. After his death, the gang continued to abuse Foudouko’s body, throwing rocks and poking it with sticks, breaking its limbs, biting it and eventually eating some of the flesh. “It was striking. The female that cannibalised the body the most, she’s the mother of the top two high-ranking males. Her sons were the only ones that really didn’t attack the body aggressively,” Pruetz says, adding that Mamadou even tried to wake his old partner. “Do chimpanzees understand death? It’s not clear if they do,” says Wilson, who studies chimpanzees in East Africa. “It seems unlikely that they know about using pulse or breath to make sure something’s dead, so we do see them beating on individuals they’ve killed after they’ve expired. But the cannibalisation was unusual.” Pruetz says since Foudouko’s death, Mamadou has been kicked out of the group by the same young males who attacked his past ally. “The way the chimps behave is the way they used to act with Foudouko [when he was trying to re-enter the group]. The saga continues,” she says. More on these topics: "
monkey,"JULIA FISCHER is a leading primatologist best known to the public for her work with a dog called Rico that she spotted on a German TV show. Rico, it was claimed, could remember the names of some 70 toys and fetch them on command. Despite Fischer’s initial scepticism, her experiments showed that the Border collie’s talents were even greater than claimed. The story of Rico and the press frenzy that followed its publication in Science is retold in Fischer’s new book Monkeytalk. It is a delight, especially when we learn that another Border collie has learned the names of 1022 toys. But to Fischer, head of the cognitive ethology department at the University of Göttingen, Germany, the story has a deeper significance. A dog’s range of barks, growls and whines is restricted, as are the vocalisations of monkeys: the vocal organs of these animals are simply not wired up to the bits of the brain that could provide the fine motor control needed. That means the range of things an animal can communicate about vocally may tell us little about what it can think about and act upon. To get “inside the worlds and minds of primates”, as the book’s sub-title claims, requires us to put aside language-biased preconceptions and to come up with imaginative experiments. Fischer’s book is a wonderful, short guide to the ingenious and patient work that is giving us deeper insights into primate psychology. I particularly loved the studies that reveal the secrets of monkey social life through broadcasting “audio dramas”, created by cutting and pasting the recorded voices of members of a monkey group. Using some hidden loudspeakers, researchers created apparently scandalous goings-on and saw how their monkey audience reacted. In one, a threat call from a low-ranking female chacma baboon was followed by the screams of a higher-ranking female from a different family, suggesting that she was being attacked. This shocking breach of inter-family etiquette excited the listeners and showed how well they knew individuals and their place in society. In another, a bachelor male heard the voice of a male grunting in the undergrowth and then his consort’s mating call some way off. The bachelor’s head spun: if the male and his consort were apart it might mean a break-up – and an opportunity. Moments later he “ambles nonchalantly towards ‘her'”, Fischer writes. These and many other experiments show that monkeys possess profound social intelligence and can solve problems in their own environment. But as we move towards more abstract intelligence and language, a gap opens up between them and us. Fischer adroitly explores the big questions now being asked about primate minds. Can they understand the intentions of others? Are they able to “time travel” and plan for the future? How much can they learn by watching others? Are they capable of metacognition, of knowing what it is that they know? Monkeytalk has its faults: it starts like a textbook and it takes a little time before you discover its unusual mix of science and insight, interspersed with funny anecdotes from African field work, including how to dress for “survival in the bureaucratic jungle”. Pink pumps, a plastic handbag, lots of rhinestones and glittery appliqué were all needed for Fischer to meet local expectations of what a lady looked like – and obtain a vehicle permit. The book ends on a serious note, though. The only way we will really understand our own origins is to explore the minds of other primate species along with the bewildering differences in the societies they live in, their ecology, neurobiology and genetics. But primate populations are being destroyed so fast that our close relatives may vanish from the wild before we can find out what made us human.

monkey,"The majority of the world’s primates are in deep trouble. There are as few as 20 or 30 Hainan gibbons left in China, and the trapdoor of extinction is gaping for the Javan slow loris. Even numbers of Madagascar’s iconic ring-tailed lemur have slumped to around 2000. These could be the next primates to disappear from our planet. But overall, the picture is even bleaker, with 60 per cent of all primate species globally predicted to vanish within between 25 and 50 years. That’s the gloomy conclusion from the largest ever review of the survival prospects of the world’s 504 known species of non-human primate, 85 of them discovered since 2000. “This paper is a synthesis of the factors, at all scales, that are causing declines and extinctions,” says Anthony Rylands of Conservation International, joint lead author of the report.
                     
 The biggest harbinger of doom is clearance of forests for agriculture, both by local farmers and by big agro-industrial producers of commodities such as palm oil and rubber. Between 1990 and 2010, for example, agricultural expansion into primate habitats was estimated at 1.5 million square kilometres, an area three times that of France. “Our paper is a plea to address the consequences of destruction and degradation of primate habitats worldwide,” says Rylands. “Agriculture as a threat can only be dealt with at all scales, influenced as it is by global trends, by government policies, corporate practices and malpractices, and regional and local policies.” Much effort could focus on just four countries – Brazil, Indonesia, Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of the Congo – which host two-thirds of all primate species. Madagascar could be a good place to start as all 111 of its lemurs are unique to the island, and 94 per cent are threatened. “Madagascar is far and away the highest primate conservation priority, in a land area that’s less than 1 per cent of all known primate habitat, but which in Madagascar is already 90 per cent cleared,” says co-author Russell Mittermeier, also at Conservation International. “The most endangered there is the northern sportive lemur, down to just 50 individuals.” All 39 ape species and subspecies, including orangutans, are now ranked as threatened with extinction. All 19 colobus species in Africa are threatened, with 12 critically endangered or endangered. And all Asian lorises are in trouble, not just from habitat loss but also through poaching and trade in their body parts.

monkey,"Rare monkeys in the forests of Brazil are being decimated by yellow fever. The outbreak started in late 2016 and, as is often the case in South America, it has spread to humans, killing at least 50 since the start of 2017. The authorities have rushed vaccines to hospitals, where long queues await inoculation. But there is no vaccine for monkeys who are dying en masse in Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais, the two states so far worst hit.
                     
 “Some 80 to 90 per cent of the brown howler monkeys are infected or have already died,” says Sergio Mendes at the Federal University of Espírito Santo in Vitoria, Brazil. “This is a true catastrophe. These outbreaks happen periodically, but this is the worst I’ve ever seen.” Mendes knows of 400 howler monkey deaths in the state, and he believes this is likely to be only 10 per cent of the total, with the greatest losses happening largely unseen in remote forested areas. Atlantic titis and geoffroy’s marmosets found dead last week in Espirito Santo are also being tested for yellow fever. Both are unique to the Mata Atlantica, one of the world’s most species-rich and most-endangered tropical forests. Other endemic primate species affected by the outbreak include the endangered buffy-headed marmoset and crested capuchin, and the critically endangered muriqui. There are only about 1000 muriqui individuals left in the wild, and their slow breeding time means numbers would take a long time to recover from yellow-fever deaths. There are also unconfirmed reports of capuchin monkeys dying of suspected yellow fever in neighbouring Minas Gerais and in São Paulo states. The virus is normally found in several forest-dwelling mammals, from marsupials to monkeys, and is transmitted by Haemagogus and Sabethes mosquitoes. Marco Almeida, a veterinary epidemiologist from Rio Grande do Sul state’s health agency, says the current outbreak is unlikely to be caused by a new, more virulent form of yellow fever virus, as it is known to mutate very slowly. Instead, he thinks recent prolonged and torrential rains provided ideal conditions for mosquitoes. Often delivering a week’s rain in a day, the deluges lasted over a month and may have weakened the monkeys by cutting the times when they can feed and challenging their immune systems. “The mosquitos can disperse across forest for up to 6 kilometres from their breeding point,” says Júlio-César Bicca-Marques, a primatolologist at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, “but they’ll also get rides in trucks. Plus, infected hunters, tree-cutters and agricultural workers can spread the virus.” It’s well known from lab tests that howlers are the most vulnerable to yellow fever of all of South America’s monkeys. “But with these current high infection levels, the virus could spread to all of the region’s 14 other primates,” says Almeida. “Part of the problem is forest fragmentation,” says primate conservationist Karen Strier of University of Wisconsin-Madison. “Only 5 per cent of Mata Atlantica remains. So Mata Atlantica primate populations are small and isolated. Wipe one out, and natural recolonization is very difficult.” With monkeys being key seed-dispersers, the prognosis for both forest and primates is not good. Meanwhile, as the epidemic increases, ill-informed individuals have started attacking the region’s monkeys, in the erroneous belief that they can spread yellow fever to humans directly.

monkey,"Baboon grunts and barks have more in common with human speech than we thought. The monkeys routinely produce five of the distinct vowel sounds found in our languages. Researchers typically link our ability to produce a range of vowels with the low position of the human voice box, or larynx, in the throat. Non-human primates have a high larynx, hence are thought to be incapable of producing many vowel sounds. But according to Joël Fagot at Aix-Marseille University and Louis-Jen Boë at the Grenoble Alps University, both in France, this standard explanation is wrong.
                     
 They point out, for instance, that infants can produce a similar range of vowels to adults even though the larynx only begins to descend midway through childhood. Fagot, Boë and their colleagues have now analysed 1300 baboon vocalisations, recorded at a primate research centre in Rousset-sur-Arc in southern France. They extracted vowel-like sounds from the calls and used software to identify the key resonant frequencies, or “formants”. The lowest two formants — denoted F1 and F2 — are known to give a reasonable indication of the position of the tongue, and can help computers classify the associated vowel sound. The team discovered that male and female baboons each produce four vowel-like sounds. Females produce one that males don’t, and vice versa, so in total there are five distinct vowels. They correspond to the second syllable in “roses”, and the vowel sounds in “you”, “thought”, “trap” and “ah”. Fagot says the work complements a study published last month by Tecumseh Fitch at the University of Vienna, Austria, and his colleagues. It concluded, through analysing macaque anatomy, that monkeys should theoretically be able to produce a range of vowel sounds. “We believe that one of the major advantages of our study is that we worked on real vocalisations, which were spontaneously produced by baboons in a social context,” says Fagot. But Philip Lieberman at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, is not convinced. He thinks the researchers have unwittingly processed the baboon calls in a way that accentuates the fundamental frequency of the call and its harmonics. In most of their analysis, Lieberman says, Fagot and Boë have then misidentified these harmonics as the F1 and F2 formants, and as a consequence they have overestimated the baboons’ vowel-making capacity. Fagot says it’s easy to make such an error, but he is adamant they did not. “We discarded any of the vocalisations for which the confusion between harmonic and formant would be possible,” he says. For Fagot, the findings raise fresh doubts about the link between the position of the larynx and the origin of spoken language. He thinks that its important features may have originated as far back as the common ancestor of monkeys and humans, which lived about 25 million years ago. Fitch agrees with this assessment. “This study corroborates our argument that primitive vocal anatomy would not have been a hindrance to evolving spoken language,” he says. “It adds fuel to the fire burning down that old misconception.” Johan Bolhuis at Utrecht University in the Netherlands says the results are interesting, but he doubts they will greatly alter our understanding of the origins of human language. “This is, in fact, additional evidence to show that with the ‘speech machinery’ being present, you do not automatically evolve language,” he says. He says language as we recognise it is a recent (and probably initially non-verbal) innovation restricted to the human lineage. Over time, language then recruited pre-existing systems, most obviously speech. “Speech does not lead to language – rather language may be externalised as speech,” says Bolhuis. A few other studies in recent years also suggest language made use of pre-existing systems. For instance, many of the genes that help us learn to talk are also active in some songbirds when they learn new songs – but birds haven’t developed language in the strictest sense, says Bolhuis.

monkey,"Oh deer! A male Japanese macaque monkey has been caught in the act of trying to mate with two Sika deer by leaping on their backs, rodeo-style. Captured in November 2015 by researchers monitoring the macaque monkeys – made famous by videos of them bathing in hot springs – the footage shows that both attempts at copulation were unsuccessful, the only genital contact being with the deer’s back (see video below). The monkey’s first attempt met with no resistance from the deer. But when he tried it with a second deer, she did her best to shake him off. Afterwards, he also appeared to try and “guard” the deer against rival monkeys.
                     
 Such observations are rare but not unheard of. In the 1990s, forest rangers reported orphan elephants attempting to mate with rhinos, and in 2008 footage was taken of a chimpanzee attempting to mate with a frog. In 2014, there were reports of sea otters attempting to mate with cormorants. Also in 2014, an Antarctic fur seal was observed attempting to mate with king penguins, some of which he subsequently ate. In this latest example, on Yakushima Island south of Japan, the perpetrator was a young male macaque – one of the more peripheral members of a larger group. This means he was probably frustrated by not having a mate. The events coincided with the monkeys’ mating season, and the researchers, led by Marie Pelé of the University of Strasbourg in France, think the hormonal surge prompted the behaviour. Pelé and her colleagues say that the habitats of the monkeys and deer overlap, and the deer often benefit when the monkeys shake down food from trees, snaffling the spoils and sometimes consuming the monkeys’ faeces. The deer also seem to tolerate periodic attempts by the monkeys to ride on their backs, which may explain the mating attempts. “It could be a manifestation of the known play behaviour between Japanese macaques and the deer they are known to sometimes ride,” she says. “Sexual interaction between non-closely-related species is very rare to observe,” says team member Sueur Cédric. Determining the causes of this is difficult, but whatever it may be, this observation might help us to understand evolution of such unusual behaviour. “It would be interesting to continue to observe these Japanese macaque male groups in Yakushima as this species is known to display cultural behaviours and social learning,” he says. “As a consequence of not having access to females, these peripheral males could socially learn to have sexual interaction with Sika deer in order to decrease their sexual frustration.” It’s not clear what, if any, impact this behaviour has on the monkeys’ survival and reproduction odds. “If they can access macaque females during the following years, their fitness should not be affected in the long-term, only in the short-term due to loss of energy, gametes and time.” Read more: Blasts from the past: The Soviet ape-man scandal; Zoologger: Necrophiliac spider mite prefers its mate dead; Male sand martin birds filmed having sex with a dead male; Monkey seen caring for dying mate then grieving after she dies More on these topics: "
monkey,"Life at the bottom of the social ladder can be damaging to health – even for monkeys. A study of rhesus monkeys has revealed the stress of low social status can be damaging to the immune system of the animals. Researchers believe the findings may help explain why people with poor and deprived backgrounds have higher rates of heart disease and diabetes, both of which are linked to inflammation.
                     
 “Social adversity gets under the skin,” says Noah Snyder-Mackler, of Duke University in the US, who co-led the investigation. “If we can help people improve their social standing and reduce some of these hierarchies, we may be able to improve people’s health and wellbeing.” In the US, life expectancy between rich and poor differs by more than a decade. American health inequality is often attributed to the availability of medical care and lifestyle habits such as smoking, exercise and diet. But the new results underline the important role played by stress. The team studied female rhesus monkeys at the Yerkes National Primate Research Centre at Emory University. First, 45 unrelated females that had never met were sorted into social groups and observed as they formed a social pecking order. Monkeys introduced to their groups earlier tended to be ranked higher than the “last in”. To find out how rank affected health, scientists measured the activity of 9,000 genes in the animals’ immune cells. Activity in more than 1,600 genes differed between lower and higher-ranking monkeys, which was especially true within “natural killer cells” – white blood cells that are a first line of defence against infection. The cells were more active in higher-ranking monkeys, giving them better protection against viruses. Lower-rankers produced a stronger immune response against bacteria, but this also fuelled potentially harmful inflammation. When their immune cells were exposed to a bacterial toxin in test tubes, they went into overdrive. “A strong inflammatory response can be life-saving in the face of infectious agents,” says co-author Luis Barreiro, of the University of Montreal in Canada. “But the same self-defence mechanism, the ones that make infected tissue swollen and red, can also cause damage if not properly controlled.” When the monkeys were re-sorted so that low-rank animals were moved up the social ladder, it had a striking effect on their immune systems. As the animals improved their social status and enjoyed the benefits, such as more grooming, their immune cells became less likely to trigger inflammation. “This suggests the health effects of status aren’t permanent, at least in adulthood,” says Jenny Tung, another member of the Duke team.   More on these topics: "
not_monkey," Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh In 2015, I wrote an article called ‘Why are We Forgetting the Tune Composers?’ regarding TG4’s decision to drop the composer category from the annual Gradam Ceoil traditional music awards. The award – Gradam an Chumadóra (‘Composer Award’) – existed between 2001 and 2013 but was then left out without explanation. It returned in 2017 for one year, but has now disappeared again. In my previous article, I mentioned dozens of prominent Irish tune composers who had not yet received the award, and now never would. When I originally wrote the piece, it did not occur to me that the article mentioned just two female composers. At the time, nobody commented on this imbalance in the article, or, if it was noticed, it wasn’t pointed out to me. However, the work of the FairPlé movement, which has raised awareness of gender imbalance in Irish traditional and folk music, has made me rethink my original piece. It is clear that I should have mentioned many more female composers. They have been marginalised in the world of traditional Irish music composition. There are so many that, were Gradam an Chumadóra to be reinstated, these composers, along with their male colleagues, would keep the award going until the 2050s. Keegan and Carroll Among the fourteen recipients of Gradam an Chumadóra since 2001, just two have been female artists – Josephine Keegan (2005) and Liz Carroll (2011). As Seán Maguire’s piano accompanist, Keegan – who is also a fiddle-player – has perhaps been overshadowed by her famous musical partner. Yet she has published four collections of over 500 tunes, the best known of which is the reel ‘The Curlew’, which has been recorded by Altan. ‘The Gates Of Mullagh’ and ‘Clear the Decks’ have also have been recorded several times. Despite her output, her work is not as well known as her male contemporaries. Is this an example of the imbalance that FairPlé has highlighted? The compositions of Chicago native Liz Carroll are better represented in sessions, recordings and concerts. She is the most celebrated female composer within the Irish tradition. In 1994, the US National Endowment for the Arts awarded her a National Heritage Fellowship for her contribution to music as both a performer and a composer. In 2010, she and John Doyle were nominated for a Grammy for their album Double Play. The same year they were invited to perform for President Obama at the White House. Carroll has hundreds of tunes, many of which are in her wonderful book Collected and on albums such as Liz Carroll, Lost in the Loop and Lake Effect. In her work she displays an ingenious gift for melody and an innovative approach to rhythm. Her best-known tunes include ‘Lost in the Loop’, ‘The Diplodocus’, ‘The Chandelier’ and ‘Lizzie in the Lowground’.   Recognition for tune composers Apart from Keegan and Carroll, however, few other female tune composers have received much recognition. Perhaps it is simply a reflection of the fact that tune composition in general is not widely recognised. If that is true, raising awareness of the many talented female tune composers is as good a place to start as any. Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh, singer and fiddle-player with Altan, has a substantial output of tunes and songs, many of which feature on Altan’s albums and her solo album Imeall. She displays a distinctive voice in her melodies, which often show a fondness for the lower reaches of the fiddle. For example, the reel ‘Loch Altan’ (from Altan’s eponymous debut) uses just one octave across the G and D strings. This creates a driving effect that is also apparent on her tune ‘The Red Crow’, the title track from Altan’s 1990 album. ‘The Red Crow’ may be Ní Mhaonaigh’s most popular tune as it has been recorded at least fifteen times. Perhaps the finest of her compositions though is the haunting jig ‘A Tune for Frankie’. The tune’s beauty lies in its melancholy pace, meandering G Dorian melody and oddly phrased rhythms which place it somewhere between a slip jig and a double jig. There’s no other tune quite like it and Altan’s recording on Blackwater from 1996 is reminiscent of the Bothy Band at their best.  Whistle- and flute-player Joanie Madden, leader of US band Cherish the Ladies, is the composer of the ubiquitous session tune ‘The Cat’s Meow’, yet she has many other compositions that have yet to receive wider recognition outside of the Irish-American scene. For example, the reel ‘The Conspiracy’ has been recorded several times and by artists such as flute-player Steph Geremia and piper Jerry O’Sullivan. O’Sullivan’s album The Invasion is named after another Madden reel. Some of her other tunes include the beautiful air ‘The Hills of New Zealand’, the reel ‘Nuala’s Bonnet’ (recorded by Cillian Vallely and Kevin Crawford) and the wonderfully titled ‘Bonkers in Yonkers’, a lively B-flat reel with a syncopated second half.  Unorthodox keysClare accordionist Josephine Marsh’s superb debut album from 1996 contains several of her compositions. In her tunes she shows a tendency to move outside the most commonly used keys and modes in traditional music. Her best known tune, the F-major reel ‘Phyllis’ Birthday’ has been recorded over twenty times. Also in F major is the distinctive jig ‘Onions and Bunions’, and the gorgeous waltz ‘Matthew’s’ is in the unorthodox key of E major. Marsh recently released a new album, Music in the Frame, which features several new compositions. Her many tunes and her innovative work with the Josephine Marsh Band mark her out as one of the finest tune composers of her generation. Máire Breatnach is a fiddle and viola player who has worked with an array of artists from The Chieftains and Mike Oldfield to Bryan Adams and Moya Brennan. Her playing can be heard on numerous film soundtracks including In the Name of the Father and Rob Roy and she was the original fiddle-player in Riverdance. Her five solo albums contain many of her own tunes, for example Angels’ Candles, her debut album, which features 14 original compositions. Her tunes have been recorded by, among others, Lúnasa (‘Hop Slide’) and Solas (‘Máire Breathnach’s #1 &amp; #2’). The handful of original compositions by fiddle-player Siobhán Peoples that feature on her album with Murty Ryan, Time on Our Hands, hint at a composer of considerable talent. ‘Legend of Lisalway’ is a jig with a beautiful ambiguity in its modal and melodic structure, and ‘Nico’s Mermaid’ is an achingly nostalgic E Dorian waltz. The unrecorded slip jig ‘Best of Friends’ contains a chromatic passage in the second part that is quite unusual for traditional Irish music.     Collection of compositionsI had mentioned Sandie Purcell briefly in the original article. However, her work deserves wider recognition. She is one of the very few female composers to have published a book of Irish tune compositions, 101 Original Compositions of Irish Traditional Music by Sandie Purcell (2007). Twenty-three of these were recorded by her group Reelan on the album The Crooked Picture. A graduate of the DIT Conservatory of Music and Drama, Purcell has also composed a seven-minute work titled ‘The Battle of Clontarf’, a commemorative commission from Dublin City Council written for piper Mark Redmond. There are many more female tune composers that merit wider recognition, including Shannon Heaton, Sharon Shannon, Liz Kane, Michelle Mulcahy, Bríd Harper, Louise Mulcahy, Zoë Conway, Emer Mayock, Karen Ryan, Caitlín Nic Gabhann, Mary Staunton, Úna Monaghan, Máire Ní Chathasaigh, Gráinne Brady, Máire O’Keeffe, Anne-Marie O’Farrell, Niamh Varian-Barry, Áine Heslin, Nuala Kennedy, Janet Harbison, Carmel Gunning, Liz Coleman, Eimear McGeown, Mary Bergin and more. This list is in no way comprehensive, but given the prominent names mentioned in this article, it can only be hoped that TG4 will reinstate the composition award soon and acknowledge a simple fact – that traditional Irish music would not exist without composers.

not_monkey," Eimear Noone (Photo: Steve Humphreys)  At one stage during the performance, the conductor invited Noone to take the role of conductor. Her friends told her it was just a gimmick. ‘Just wave your arms around’, they said, ‘It’s just a bit of a joke.’  But they didn’t know that Noone had actually been studying scores at home for years, ‘watching videos of conductors, anything I could get at the library, trying to figure out what on earth they were doing, looking at diagrams.’  Noone began learning music at school on tin whistle, playing traditional music, but also, prophetically, given how her career would develop, picking up themes from television by ear. She moved on to flute and piano, and travelled every Saturday to the Royal Irish Academy of Music in Dublin for lessons.  As a teenager, she was also composing and arranging. She worked with the local musical society, and participated in a young composers’ workshop and competition with the National Chamber Choir under conductor Colin Mawby. She didn’t win the competition, but Mawby saw potential and applied for a place for her at the Irish Composition Summer School in Ennis. She was only 17, and she returned the next year too.  One of the tutors on the course, Finnish composer Kalevi Aho, had a particularly big impact on her. ‘I remember he made everyone cry, but we got on great’ she says. Aho said composers should avoid surrounding themselves with ‘too many musical platitudes’, that is, idioms and styles that they think they should not write in, because they will ultimately box themselves in. For Noone, it was liberating.  Film musicShe undertook a degree in music at Trinity College Dublin and started to gravitate towards film music, co-founding the Dublin City Concert Orchestra with her classmate Jillian Saunders and running it for five years. Set up to perform film music and popular classical works, the orchestra gave the Irish premieres of a range of well-known scores.  Since last autumn, Noone has been conducting a concert series throughout Europe and in the United States called Callas in Concert, featuring a hologram of Maria Callas singing with a live orchestra.

not_monkey," Anthony Long, General Manager of the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra When RTÉ published an external review of its two orchestras last April, it detailed an alarming range of difficulties: 16 unfilled positions, no principal conductors, management and administrative vacancies, fewer concerts, a decline in national touring and educational work, and appearing in just 4% of RTÉ Lyric FM’s broadcasting of orchestral music. The report said that the RTÉ National Symphony’s Orchestra’s current number of full-time musicians made it ‘one of the smallest [symphony orchestras] in Europe.’ More severely, morale among the musicians was low. Members of the orchestra complained that there was ‘no sense of direction for either orchestra’; the report commented that there was a ‘a highly charged, inward and mistrustful culture in the orchestras’; and musicians and staff felt that the reduction in the number of performances had had ‘a detrimental impact on public value and orchestral competence.’ Leaving RTÉThe response from the Irish Government was relatively swift. On 5 July 2018, it agreed in principal that the National Symphony Orchestra, after 70 years in RTÉ, was to be moved and would come under the remit of the National Concert Hall, but that the Concert Orchestra would stay in RTÉ. The Government said it would immediately establish an oversight group to begin discussions on the move.  So what has been happening since? Speaking to The Journal of Music, Anthony Long says it’s a complex process that will take time. There have been some high-level meetings. We’re moving along reasonably carefully, which is, in my view, a very good thing because we’ve got one chance to get this right. We’ve got a wonderful opportunity to cement the future of the National Symphony Orchestra. We’re firmly embedded in RTÉ and we need to work out how a relationship in a new setting will work. There’s a lot of work to be done, in terms of musicians’ conditions, and that needs to be done sensitively, so that when we land it’s the best thing for everybody. While discussions are ongoing, there is as yet no set schedule for the move ‘because it’s never been done before’, yet Long believes that ‘once the underwriting of the orchestra – the financial position – is stabilised… that’s the best outcome.’ But how did things get to such a serious stage for the orchestras after 70 years of stewardship in RTÉ? Cuts due to the recession and the changing media landscape were a major issue, he says, but there was also an underestimation of what it takes to support orchestral music. The great thing about the report was that it focussed all of the key stakeholders on the importance and the fragile nature of the provision of orchestral music in Ireland. It also lay down a possible plan for the future. I thought some of the criticism [in the report] was justified, but at the same time I think criticism can be justified and unfair. It didn’t always take into consideration that RTÉ had supported the orchestras for 70 years, which I think has to be commended, even though I’m sure a lot of critics wouldn’t agree. The overall positive outcome is that it’s looking for a commitment from the Government and RTÉ to fund the orchestras going forward. Audience increaseBetween the report last April and the Government announcement in July, one piece of news was strikingly good. In June, RTÉ’s annual report showed that the NSO audience had increased by 53% in 2017, and those figures have been sustained for 2018. The beginning of 2019 has also been signifiant in that the NSO has just announced its new Chief Conductor, Jaime Martín, filling a position that has been vacant since 2016. The Spanish conductor and flautist, also recently appointed as Music Director of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, begins a three-season contract at the NSO this September.  Complex recruitmentMaking the appointment was one of the first things on Long’s agenda when he became manager, although the process was quite extended. ‘He was always on my radar. I saw him once or twice obviously. You sort of get a sixth sense about these things. He was one of the first people I invited in.’ From my perspective, a conductor has to be all things to all people. … As a conductor, as a professional flautist at the highest level, [Martín] knows the job from inside of the orchestra; and as director of the Santander International Festival, at which he doesn’t play or conduct, he knows it from the management point of view. He’s ideal. The process of recruiting orchestra members can be complex – taking up to a year or more to trial a musician. This is part of the reason why vacancies grew at the NSO and CO. The vacancies built up because RTÉ found itself in a situation every couple of years where it needed to make cuts. It can take a couple of years to fill a job in an orchestra. Each time the shutters came down across the entire organisation [recruitment of orchestral members stopped], but when the shutters went up it took the orchestras a while to audition, to trial, to get people in.  The NSO is currently trialling musicians for four positions; and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra has also just advertised for a General Manager, a position that has been vacant since Long left it, although Gareth Hudson has been Executive Producer and acting manager. Orchestra development and programmingThe National Symphony Orchestra has traditionally focussed on the core classical canon and contemporary music, while the Concert Orchestra – although it plays classical and contemporary repertoire too – is well known for working across a range of genres. For Long, the difference in managing the two is about repertoire but also planning cycle. The planning for the NSO could be two years in advance, whereas the CO, as a smaller orchestra, can be more commercially opportunistic. In his years with the CO, the orchestra’s profile rose considerably, particularly with performances with Jenny Greene at the Electric Picnic festival. The idea of putting a DJ with an orchestra had been tried [in concert halls], but we took it into a dance setting. The orchestrators that we used – we got them to enhance the orchestrations. When we realised that we had something special, that was amazing. His approach to programming at the NSO is influenced by his years at the CO, and he talks about ‘orchestra development’, not just ‘audience development’. Orchestra development is ‘developing the music that the orchestra plays, looking at the way we can present it and who we present it to.’ Our [NSO] audience tends to be reasonably conservative in its tastes. I don’t think that’s unfair. I don’t think it’s a bad thing to say either. We have to make sure that we cater for those people. The last thing you want to do is alienate your audience, especially those who come week in, week out. The NSO’s current season has received criticism for not performing enough contemporary music and in particular works by Irish composers. Long is conscious of the neglect of Irish work. I can honestly say over the past couple of years that we haven’t championed as many composers as we would have liked to do, but that comes down to the fact that our budgets have decreased significantly as RTÉ’s budgets have decreased.  We haven’t had the finance to commission as much as we would like. That being said, we need to look at how this is done and how we present it. One of the things we’re doing is going back through the catalogue of music we’ve already commissioned and seeing where and when we could programme that.  He is currently talking to four Irish composers about new commissions, one of which is Donnacha Dennehy. The NSO will premiere a new orchestral work by him in 2021. Next week at New Music Dublin, there will be premieres by Jennifer Walshe and David Fennessy that are also RTÉ commissions. The other thing that I make no secret about is I want to look at older Irish music. I don’t want to forget those composers… they have dropped off the radar as well. This sub-season that we have running through the seasons, Towards 2020 [featuring, most recently, Ina Boyle, Charles Villiers Stanford and John Buckley], it’s a simple effort to get some of that music back into our repertoire. One positive aspect of the external review, he feels, is that it acknowledged the importance of orchestral provision to Irish culture.  I think a lot of people think that Western classical music isn’t really part of our culture. There’s a perception that it’s not Irish culture, but I would totally refute that, given that our history goes back beyond Handel’s Messiah to Geminiani and O’Carolan. And I think composers like Stanford are neglected. We need to reclaim them.  Putting the ‘National’ back in the NSOAcross commissioning, recruitment and more, Long reckons that, post-report, it is now possible for the NSO to start to plan properly again, but putting the ‘National’ back in the NSO is essential. We are too Dublin 2-centric… I absolutely want to see the reinstatement of the two national tours that we use to do, and I think, in an ideal circumstance, with the right kind of funding, we would not be just rehearsing here for a Friday-night concert, but that concert would be repeated at a venue outside of Dublin. [We cannot] neglect the fact that we are a National Symphony Orchestra and we should be playing outside of Dublin more often. Tours also contribute to the morale of the orchestra. Has morale improved since the issues highlighted in the report? ‘We were starting from a very low base… there will be a lot of things that will influence the morale in the orchestra other than the current predicament.’ It has improved but it varies. ‘If we’ve poor attendances at concerts that will influence morale. If there are other issues going on, non-musical, that will influence morale as well.’ New appointments can have a positive impact though. For Jaime Martín’s recent concert (18 January) featuring Barry Douglas playing Brahms’ second piano concerto, ‘There was an extra electricity in the air’ – it was a ‘wonderful evening.’  Touring nationally is good for orchestras, he argues, because they are getting a chance to repeat a programme so they get to know the music better, they get to know their colleagues better too, and they are playing for audiences that don’t usually see them. ‘Without an audience we’re nothing’, Long says. ‘The more audiences we can play to the better.’ The next RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra concert takes place on Friday 22 February at the National Concert Hall and features conductor Cristian Măcelaru and violinist Vilde Frang. The programme includes Rimsky-Korsakov’s Russian Easter Overture, Stravinsky’s Violin Concerto and Tchaikobsky’s Manfred Symphony.

not_monkey," Kaija Saariaho (photo: Andrew Campbell) Later this month, Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho will be one of the featured international composers of this year’s New Music Dublin festival. A selection of her chamber and orchestral works will be performed, including Irish premieres. Saariaho is one of the most wide-ranging composers prominent today, known for her palette of orchestral colours and her blending of live instruments with electronics to create new fluid soundscapes. She has won a number of significant awards, including the Polar Music Prize in 2013, and her commissions include works for the LA Philharmonic, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, BBC and more. Her work has been performed in Ireland a number of times, including a performance of her Circle Map with Dublin Sound Lab and the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra in 2016.  Several instrumentsSaariaho began her musical studies at age six playing several instruments – piano, organ and guitar as well as violin – and started composing at around the age of ten. She studied first at the Sibelius Academy before moving to Germany to attend the Hochschule für Musik, and then to Paris (where she still lives) at the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM).  Speaking to The Journal of Music about her musical career, she lists influences as varied as Berio, classical Indian music and Billie Holiday, though she thinks ‘the further one gets in one’s work, maybe less important are the influences as you are really immersed in your own musical language and you live more and more in your own universe.’  This musical language contains rich orchestral sonic worlds, spectralist textural works and compositions with electronics. Given this plurality of approaches and sounds, Saariaho avoids categorising her musical language. I think music is a very complex and profound way of communication and it’s not very easy to verbalize the meaning of that for a musician or composers. It’s a way to perceive and imagine the world, and try to communicate feelings and thoughts to other people around you.  Saariaho – who has written four operas and a significant number of works for voice and choir – selects her subject matter very carefully to achieve this communication with the listener. Often this is through text, which must be a text that ‘invites into my mind some music’, but the source of ideas can be ‘very diverse’: It can be a certain kind of light, or another experience can be a starting point for a work, but then the working process is always similar. It’s composition and then it’s all about the musical questions – how to organise, how to build, how to express this.  Reinterpreting the concertoA number of works by Saariaho will be performed as part of New Music Dublin, including by musicians of the Royal Irish Academy of Music and the Paris Conservatoire (1 March, 2.30pm). Ensemble Intercontemporain will perform her Dolce Tormento (2 March, 9.30pm) in a concert of music for small ensemble and electronics. The major featured work though is the Irish premiere of her violin concerto, Graal théâtre, which will be performed by the RTÉ Concert Orchestra conducted by Robert Houlihan with soloist Hae-Sun Kang, paired with Louis Andriessen’s Vermeer Pictures (1 March, 7.30pm).    Graal théâtre was written in 1994 for Latvian violinist Gidon Kremer, who performed it with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen. The title is from a book of the same name by Jacques Roubaud, who reinterpreted the stories of the holy grail into contemporary poetic language. Saariaho found a connection because she felt she was reinterpreting the violin concerto in her own language, in which the ‘performer is like a main character of a play’. It has this strange title because I wanted to express something very personal about the violin. I wanted to search for something profound and important musically.  First of all it was really difficult for me because I love so many violin concertos. I felt there was not so much that I could add to the rich repertoire that the violin has already. But I took the idea of a contrast of different relationships with the orchestra and built a dramatic part where the violin becomes this person – this principal role in the middle of the orchestra. Saariaho describes the work as being in two parts. In the first, the violin is ‘travelling through different musical landscapes’, leaving traces in the orchestra. The second is more confrontational, as the violin and orchestra find ‘a new way of co-existing where both elements are very active in the musical texture’.  This will be the first time the work has been performed by soloist Hae-Sun Kang, who, like the composer, is based in Paris.  Always when I write a concerto it is written for a certain person, and somehow they are a kind of portrait of those people. Then when other people take those works, I have seen that the music is flexible enough that everyone’s version is quite different. The music has quite a strong identity… but I’m sure she will bring her own character to [it].  New Music Dublin takes place on 28 February–3 March at the National Concert Hall.

not_monkey," Despite the ‘Love your Orchestras’ tagline it is hard to imagine a more unloved fixture in the Irish music calendar than the RTÉ NSO’s ‘Music of Our Time’ concerts at the National Concert Hall. Devoted to contemporary music, these concerts have traditionally taken place on a Tuesday lunchtime and are a rebranded version of the Horizons series which dates back to the early 2000s. Exactly how they have managed to survive in the era of slash-and-burn arts budgets is something of a mystery particularly when one considers the attendance at last Tuesday’s concert (9 October 2018). This turned out to be one of those disheartening occasions when the members of the orchestra outnumbered the audience. A quick count of the people in the hall while the first piece was being introduced resulted in a tally of seventy, exactly the same amount as the musicians on stage as an additional count subsequently revealed. Unfortunately however, when conductor Gavin Moloney appeared on the podium, he tipped the balance back in favour of the orchestra.  Most musicians will at some point in their career experience the rather depressing situation where audience turnout is so poor that the ensemble exceeds the audience. But most don’t expect it to happen when they play in a national symphony orchestra and while I’m not a conductor, I imagine it’s hardly good for morale. Aodán Ó Dubhghaill, Head of RTÉ Orchestras, said yesterday at an Oireachtas committee meeting that morale within the orchestras is already low as a result of recent cuts.  A proper marketing strategyThe reasons why these concerts have no audience are not difficult to fathom. The Tuesday lunchtime slot is a very inconvenient time for most except those who are retired, unemployed or happen to work nearby, though the office workers in the law and accountancy firms in the vicinity of Earlsfort Terrace have so far declined to turn out in their droves to keep abreast of the latest developments in new music.  The chance of attracting an audience to any event also requires a proper marketing strategy. It should be pointed out that the NSO’s Summer lunchtime concerts of light classical fare – which also take place on a Tuesday lunchtime – are always well-attended and indeed often sell-out. This is because they are relentlessly plugged on RTÉ Lyric FM and the programme is publicised well in advance. Of course, marketing a concert of contemporary music presents more challenges but there should be certain minimum expectations as far as advertising is concerned. Yet Tuesday’s concert was not included in the RTÉ NSO season brochure for this year nor was it even listed in the NCH’s September–October booklet. Such a casual approach to marketing is indicative of an event that was put together at short notice without much thought put into audience development.   This was not always the case. In the 2016–17 NSO brochure the two ‘Music of Our Time’ concerts scheduled for that season were given a full page each. Similarly, the Horizons series used to take place at a set time each year in January and the programme was always announced well beforehand. While audience numbers were never spectacular, they were at least several multiples of the musicians on stage. On Tuesday it was also noticeable that the NCH’s usual strategy of busing in groups of secondary school kids to soften the deserted look in the auditorium was not deployed.   No visionIn an interview with the composer Raymond Deane published in the Journal of Music last week, I lamented the fact that as regards new music in Ireland, the problem is not that significant things don’t happen. Things do happen, it’s just that there’s no vision or desire to carry these initiatives to their full potential. While I recognise the financial difficulties that Ó Dubhghaill referred to yesterday at the Oireachtas meeting, the NSO’s relationship with contemporary orchestral music could be a very positive and productive one if curated properly. On the other hand, it is highly costly to assemble seventy professional musicians for a lunchtime concert, not to mention the several hours rehearsal time necessary to prepare for the performance. The box-office takings from Tuesday – €5 per ticket and free for students – would barely have made a dent in this expense and such extravagance must surely raise the occasional eyebrow in the accountancy division of RTÉ. I don’t want to sound like the populist radio commentator Ivan Yates, but this doesn’t perhaps represent the best allocation of public funds for the arts. So what could be done to give these concerts a sense of purpose? Well, here’s an idea. I mentioned earlier the presence of secondary-school students at these concerts accompanied by their music teachers. When the Australian composer Brett Dean conducted a concert last year there was probably a hundred or so teenagers in the audience. However, the NCH has capacity for 1200 people so why not make full use of this space, pack it out and host a free concert or series of concerts specifically designed as an introduction to contemporary music for secondary-school music students. This could feature a breakdown of a particular piece, a discussion of the instruments of the orchestra, and an interview with the composer. An event like this would be comparatively easy to organise and is exactly the kind of long-term planning that could contribute to ensuring healthy audience numbers for the future. Indeed, one of the composers featured in Tuesday’s concert – Brian Irvine – has considerable experience working with youth orchestras and would be an ideal candidate to front such an initiative.  As regards the promotion of contemporary orchestral music amongst the broader public, this really needs to happen in the Friday night main season concerts where pieces are programmed alongside standard repertoire and performed to large audiences. At the New Music Dublin ‘defrosted’ festival two weeks ago the NSO performed two stunning concertos for traditional instruments – the sheng and the uilleann pipes – by the South Korean composer Unsuk Chin and the South African-born Irish composer Kevin Volans. This is exactly the kind of contemporary repertoire that the regular patrons of the NSO should have the opportunity to hear and if performed on a regular basis there could be the real possibility of developing a serious audience for new work which is, of course, the life blood of any art form. On the other hand, the ghettoisation of contemporary music, as demonstrated by these ‘Music of Our Time’ concerts in their current format, does more harm than good and only reinforces the idea that contemporary music is a fringe activity operating on the margins of our cultural life.  Adrian Smith is Lecturer in Musicology at DIT Conservatory of Music and Drama.

not_monkey,"There’s nothing quite like watching a dog experience snow for the first time. Not all dogs are suited for outdoor play in cold weather, though. Our experts offer winter safety tips for dogs in snow so they can enjoy the winter wonderland. Some dogs have thick coats designed to withstand cold temperatures, whereas others have thin coats that don’t keep them warm. When it comes to spending time outside this winter, use your best judgment. Consider the thickness of your dog’s coat and his age, as puppies and senior dogs have a harder time regulating their body temperature. A good rule of thumb is if it’s too cold for you in your winter coat, it’s too cold for your dog. Here are some other winter safety tips from one of our expert veterinarians. According to Dr. RuthAnn Lobos, veterinarian and Purina’s Senior Manager of Training, “The key is acclimation. If they seem fine and aren’t shivering or trying to get in, it’s perfectly fine for them to stay outside for longer periods as long as they’re building up to it.” Start with short sessions outside and slowly increase so they have time to adjust. Try shoveling a patch of grass for potty time so they have a spot to go right away. If there are areas with more protection from snow, ice and wind, encourage your pup to go there instead. Give treats after to reinforce the good behavior and discourage accidents inside. Rock salt isn’t toxic, but it may upset their stomach if ingested and can irritate their paws. Antifreeze tastes sweet but is toxic. Look for blue or green-colored substances on driveways, sidewalks and cars and keep dogs away from those spots. Wipe off their paws before they come inside to remove any salt or antifreeze residue they might lick off. This will also warm the paws faster. If your dog seems cold, cover him with a towel or blanket. You can also use a blow dryer on a low setting, but don’t heat his paw pads, as they could burn. Instead, heat up some rice in a sock (place against your wrist to ensure it’s not too hot). If you know your dog gets cold easily, stock up in advance on sweaters, coats and booties. For cracked paw pads, use a moisturizer made for cow udders to soothe your dog’s paws. After applying, keep him busy with a puzzle feeder or treat so he doesn’t lick it off immediately. To protect your dog’s paws in winter and prevent cracked pads, try putting your dog in booties. Otherwise clean his paws every time he comes inside. Idle time can lead to destructive or nervous behavior due to pent-up energy. Once you’ve acclimated your dog and prepared for cold weather, continue walking your dog in winter and let him play outside. You could even get creative and build a small agility course out of piles of snow. If conditions are too cold or icy, consider an indoor gym for dogs or give them a puzzle feeder or play indoor games to keep them busy.

See how professional trainer, Joanne Barrett helps this dog family grow stronger.  Chewing is normal for dogs, but it can cause problems when your shoes, books or furniture are the targets. Correcting problem chewing is often simply a matter of preventing unwanted chewing while encouraging your dog to chew appropriate dog toys. If chewing only happens when left alone, try confinement (see How I Crate Train My Dog?), and speak to a qualified dog trainer or behaviorist as this may be a sign of separation anxiety or boredom.Why Dogs Chew
Chewing is usually a healthy, normal thing to do when it isn't destructive. Dogs chew for many reasons: 
Keep in mind that some behavior that looks like chewing or biting is actually exploratory 'mouthing.' Dogs learn about an object's feel and texture with their mouths in the way people learn those things by feeling with their hands. Correcting Inappropriate Chewing

not_monkey,"Carrots are a versatile vegetable. They can stand alone as a snack, pair with a roast and potatoes or add flavor to stock or soup. The vitamins and minerals this vegetable contains make them great for humans, but can dogs eat carrots? Purina experts say yes, dogs can eat carrots. Not only can they eat them, but most dogs also enjoy them. Below our experts explain why carrots are good for dogs, how to serve them and more. Like many other fruits and vegetables, dogs can have carrots. In fact, every part of this vegetable, from the carrot itself to the leafy green tops are safe for dogs to eat. They’re a good, natural treat, and most dogs like the flavor, too. Carrots contain essential vitamins and minerals like beta carotene (which the body converts to vitamin A), vitamin K, potassium and more. Although these nutrients are good for humans, can dogs reap the same benefits? Because you aren’t relying on carrots alone to give your dog the nutrients he needs, he’s unlikely to see major benefits from small amounts of this vegetable. That said, it’s still a healthy and tasty treat for your pooch.   In moderation, carrots are a healthy, low-calorie treat. Like other fruits and vegetables, though, they’re high in natural sugar. This is why dogs (and humans) find them so tasty. Too much sugar, even the natural kind, can cause weight gain, which can lead to other health problems. “The same rules apply to serving carrots as they do with any other treat,” says Purina Senior Nutritionist Jan Dempsey. Meaning carrots should make up no more than 10% of your dog’s daily calories. Although dogs aren’t usually at risk for cavities, too many high-sugar treats could lead to dental decay. Unlike more abrasive dog food and treats, which clean the teeth, carrots won’t clean your dog’s teeth as he eats. Before giving your dog a new food, check with your veterinarian to get the ideal serving size. You can slice them into rounds or cut them into sticks or smaller or larger pieces, depending on your dog’s size. Your dog may enjoy the crunch and flavor of raw carrots, but if he doesn’t like them raw, try giving him cooked carrots. If you’re worried about altering the carrots’ nutritional value by cooking them, don’t. “Steaming or cooking minimally in the microwave shouldn’t cause a major change in vitamins and minerals in carrots,” says Dempsey. “But don’t boil the vegetable, since boiling tends to leach out nutrients. Just know however you fix them, carrots are not bad for dogs.” Always follow your veterinarian’s advice, even with people foods safe for dogs. Doing so helps to protect your pup from digestive upset, weight gain and other health problems. If your dog loves carrots, consider giving him Beyond Grain Free Chicken, Carrot &amp; Pea Wet Dog Food or treating him to Beneful Break-N-Bites Dog Treats with Real Chicken, Carrots &amp; Sweet Potatoes.

not_monkey,"Bennu isn’t a cold, dead rock after all. NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission has spotted the asteroid spewing out dust and rocks on 11 separate occasions over a period of just a few weeks, which was completely unexpected. For the most part, Bennu is as we predicted before OSIRIS-REx arrived there in December: it is shaped like a spinning top and rotates once every 4.3 hours, it’s not very dense and its surface is one of the darkest in the solar system. But the particles flying off its surface are something new. They range in size from a few centimetres to tens of centimetres. At least four appear to have ended up in orbit around Bennu, forming what are essentially miniature moons around the asteroid. Bennu itself orbits the sun mostly between Earth and Mars.
                     
 “We have had spacecraft around other asteroids, and nothing like this was ever reported,” says Andrew Rivkin at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. “The question is, why is this asteroid different?” One major difference is that, unlike the other asteroids we’ve been to, Bennu is full of hydrated minerals, which have water locked into their molecular structure. If it also has ice under its rocky surface, heat from the sun could be turning into gas and blowing rocks away, Rivkin says. That would mean that Bennu didn’t form where it is now, because it is too warm there to maintain much ice for long. For now, it will remain a mystery. “Every time we go to an asteroid, we find we don’t know them as well as we thought we did,” Rivkin says. Efforts to learn more about Bennu may be hampered by another surprise: its surface is covered in large boulders, which could make it more difficult for NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft to grab a sample from its surface. Instead of smooth areas coated in dust, the surface has thousands of small boulders and more than 200 that are over 10 metres across. We only expected one rock this big from images taken before the spacecraft entered orbit. The mission was designed to pick up samples from dusty regions, not rocky ones. The team has only found a few areas that will work, but they are confident they will still be able to get a sample. “We have a very capable spacecraft and we can adapt,” says OSIRIS-REx project scientist Jason Dworkin at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. “It is a solvable situation.” Choosing exactly where to take a sample will be a hard choice, as the surface appears to vary considerably. “Some areas look smooth and shiny, and some look dull and bumpy,” says Dworkin. The spacecraft spotted individual boulders containing variations in brightness of up to 33 per cent. It’s not clear yet if this is due to an actual texture difference, a result of compositional differences on the surface, or simply a trick of the light, says Dworkin. NASA is still working on chemical analysis of Bennu’s surface, which would provide firmer answers. If the diversity is really there, it may mean that Bennu’s surface has some pristine areas that are remnants of the original, larger rock it originally chipped off from, as well as some relatively fresh spots that have undergone recent activity. The observations, presented today at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas, led Dworkin and his colleagues to suggest that Bennu is probably about 100 million to one billion years old, which is a older than we expected, and its surface may contain rocks that are even older than that. We won’t know for sure where Bennu’s diversity comes from until OSIRIS-REx brings its sample back to Earth in 2023, Dworkin says. Because Bennu is a relic from the age of planet formation in the early solar system, these samples may help us understand how planets like Earth formed and where Earth got its water and complex chemistry.

not_monkey,"Ryugu is a strangely dry space rock. Japan’s Hayabusa-2 spacecraft has sent back its first data on the asteroid, and surprisingly it appears to have nearly no water at all. Hayabusa-2 arrived at Ryugu in June 2018 and has since dropped off three landers and taken one sample of dust from the surface. It has also taken pictures and measurements of the asteroid’s surface composition. The first analyses of the data were presented today at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas. The asteroid’s spinning-top shape and equatorial ridge suggest that it may have once rotated about twice as fast as it does now, completing a full turn in under 4 hours. It could have been gradually slowed down by the force of sunlight hitting it, says team member Seiji Sugita at the University of Tokyo.
                     
 The measurements also showed that Ryugu’s surface is fairly uniform. It is extremely dark, reflecting less than 2 per cent of the light that hits it. Comparisons with meteorites we have collected on Earth – which were heated as they passed through our atmosphere – show the colours match, suggesting the asteroid was heated up in the past, perhaps when it was chipped off from its parent body. That could also explain why there seems to be very little water on the asteroid – surprisingly less than the asteroid Bennu, which is the target of NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission. Based on where Ryugu probably formed, it is unlikely that it was dry from the start, says Sugita. “Our preferred scenario is that the parent body acquired water and then subsequently re-expelled most of the water,” he says. Because Ryugu’s surface is so homogeneous, its parent body may have lost its water through heating from radioactive materials rather than being hit by other objects, which wouldn’t affect the entire asteroid equally. “Some people are disappointed that it’s uniform everywhere,” says Sugita. But, he says, that also means that all of the different components are well-mixed, so a sample taken anywhere on the asteroid should have bits of every kind of rock that is there. Researchers have long thought that asteroids like Ryugu may have brought water and other ingredients for life to Earth in the distant past. If it turns out that many of them, like Ryugu, don’t have any water, we may have to recalculate and look for the font of life elsewhere.

not_monkey,"Killing bacteria in space is surprisingly hard. Space missions have been plagued by bacterial biofilms that have coated surfaces and corroded equipment. Now, an antimicrobial metal surface that explodes bacteria on contact has been tested on the International Space Station (ISS), and it may be used in future missions to keep astronauts healthy. Elisabeth Grohmann at the Beuth University of Applied Sciences Berlin and her colleagues tested an antimicrobial coating called AGXX, which consists of thin layers of the metals silver and ruthenium treated with vitamin C.
                     
 They affixed metal sheets to a contamination-prone surface: the ISS’s bathroom door. Taking swabs at six, 12, and 19 months, the team found that compared with sheets of stainless steel and silver, the AGXX surface had a significantly reduced number of bacteria. AGXX works via a redox reaction between the silver and ruthenium, producing free radicals that damage bacterial cell membranes. “They really explode the bacteria,” says Grohmann. Over time, some bacteria grew, but by 19 months there were 80 per cent fewer strains on the AGXX than on the steel. No serious illness-causing bugs were found, says Grohmann, but most strains found were resistant to at least three antibiotics. Spacecraft are ripe environments for bacterial resistance, partly because there isn’t the normal competition between the human-associated bacteria and bugs from environment. Certain strains develop thicker cell walls and others multiply faster in microgravity. Astronauts on the ISS aren’t allowed to use aerosol cleaning agents, or liquids containing flammable alcohol, so new antimicrobial fixes are in high demand. The study concluded in 2015, and since then the antimicrobial properties of AGXX have been improved, says Grohmann. The coating will next be tested in a joint isolation mission between NASA and Russia’s Institute of Biomedical Problems. More on these topics: "

 “Wood could be used in cars,” says materials scientist Liangbing Hu at the University of Maryland. He recently received a massive grant to build cars out of high-tech wood, and he doesn’t have the road to himself. Engineers in Japan are also working on a wooden concept car due to be unveiled at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. But cars are just the green shoots of a growing wood revolution. In materials science labs and design studios around the world, people are working on an entire civilisation built from wood. In this future, steel, concrete, plastics and even electronics have been felled by wood. Wooden cars ply streets towered over by wooden skyscrapers with wooden windows. Wooden aeroplanes fly overhead, powered by wooden batteries. People wear wooden clothes and use mobile phones made from wood. It may sound like toy town, but it is deadly serious.

not_monkey,"Aircraft safety is in the spotlight after an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed earlier this week, killing more than 150 people. The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has subsequently banned the aircraft type from operating in the UK, following similar action in other countries around the world. Flying is still very safe overall, but questions remain about this particular Boeing 737 Max models and the causes of the recent crash. What has happened?
A Boeing 737 Max 8, operated by Ethiopian Airlines, crashed on Sunday 10 March shortly after take-off from Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board. Details are still scarce and an investigation will take place in the coming days and weeks. The plane’s black box was recovered on 11 March. An Ethiopian Airlines spokesperson said the company has decided to ground its fleet of Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft “as an extra safety precaution”. Is this the first time the Boeing 737 Max 8 has been involved in a crash?
It isn’t. Lion Air flight 610 used the same type of plane and crashed 12 minutes after take-off from Jakarta in October 2018, killing 189 people on board.
                     
 The 737 Max 8 involved in Sunday’s crash was only registered in November, and is one of 350 such planes currently in operation. The order book for the plane – the latest version of Boeing’s classic 737 – is long, with more than 5000 ordered since 2017. Is the 737 Max 8 dangerous? 
In November, following the Lion Air crash, Boeing issued a warning to airlines that the Max 8 flight monitoring system can throw up incorrect readings that cause the autopilot to dive rapidly, thinking that the plane is in a mid-air stall. That Boeing alert, and a subsequent one by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) indicated that they believed the crash could have been caused by a faulty angle-of-attack sensor, which measures how air flows over the wings.  The angle-of-attack sensor was replaced on Lion Air flight 610 the day before the accident because it had failed. “It was certified as safe by the appropriate regulatory authorities,” says Graham Braithwaite at Cranfield University, UK. “The investigators will need to ensure nothing was missed in that process.” Boeing 737-600s have an accident rate of fewer than one in every 5 million departures. Back-of-the-envelope analysis by David Gleave at Loughborough University, UK, shows the accident rate of a 737 Max, which has a more efficient engine and wing design than its predecessors, is now six or seven times that – although it is still extremely low. Do we know what went wrong?
No. While people are pointing to the similar circumstances around the Ethiopian and Lion Air crashes – both happened shortly after take-off, with both planes seemingly unable to ascend properly – it is still too early to tell. “There could be a correlation but no common causation,” says Gleave. Are there more plane crashes now or are we just noticing them more?
Accident rates are still very low in commercial aviation and the number of aircraft in the air is increasing. A 2013 study by researchers at Northwestern University in Illinois found that 0.07 people die for every billion miles travelled on planes, compared with 7.3 people on cars, and 0.43 people on trains. Recent plane accidents will hardly dent these statistics. “The 737 Max accidents are high profile partly because it’s a new version and partly because both were total losses,” says Braithwaite. Where is the Boeing 737 Max allowed to operate? 
Ethiopian Airlines has grounded its fleet of 737 Max 8s, and regulators in China, the UK, Germany, France, Australia, Malaysia and Singapore have banned Boeing 737 Max aircraft from flying in their airspace. Airlines in Oman, Norway and South Korean have also decided to stop flying the model temporarily. The US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) says that the Boeing 737 Max 8 is airworthy and will not ground the model. US transportation secretary Elaine Chao said the US government would “take immediate and appropriate action” if any defects are found. What happens next?
Boeing and technical teams from Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Kenya have joined up with aviation experts and the Ethiopian authorities to investigate the cause of the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Boeing is also expected to reveal improvements to the faulty angle-of-attack sensor, and release new training requirements and flight crew materials, all of which might have contributed to the Lion Air crash in October.

not_monkey,"There’s so much to enjoy in the summertime! Unfortunately, many people don't let their dogs in on the fun because they're worried about the extreme heat and more. Good news! Your four-legged friend can enjoy the great outdoors if you follow these six key tips for keeping dogs cool and safe. Keeping dogs cool in summer requires keeping plenty of water on hand. One of the easiest ways to keep your dog cool and hydrated is to carry a portable, collapsible water bowl and bottles of cold water. Make sure your dog drinks water every hour. If he starts panting excessively, get him into the shade and offer more water right away. One way to keep your dog cool during outdoor gatherings is to allow him to swim or do other water play activities. Always check out the gathering venue ahead of time to determine what water options are available for your dog. It's also a good idea to bring a few old towels along to dry your dog after he plays. Avoid exercising with your dog on those hotter days, and if you must, at least avoid the midday hours or anytime it seems too hot for yourself. When going for a walk, avoid hot asphalt that can burn your pet’s paws, keep running to a minimum, and bring plenty of cold water to keep your dog cool. With all the tragic stories in the news, this should go without saying — but you should never ever leave your dog in a parked car, not even for a moment. According to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “Cars parked in direct sunlight can reach internal temperatures up to 131°F-172°F when it’s 80°F-100°F outside.” Even with the windows cracked, temperatures rise quickly – hot enough to cause irreversible organ damage or even death. Dog houses aren’t safe in hot weather, because they block air flow and trap the heat inside. If your pet is outside, be sure to keep him or her in the shade when possible, with plenty of water on hand. You can add ice to their water bowl if it’s especially hot to help keep your dog cool when he’s outside. Heatstroke is a serious hazard for dogs on hot days, especially those who are very young or old, or not in good health. Watch for the following signs of heatstroke in your dog: If you see any of these signs in your dog, move him or her into a cooler environment right away and call your veterinarian. You can use ice packs and give your pet some cool water to alleviate the condition until you get to the veterinarian’s office. Many of the complications from heatstroke do not begin to appear until several days after the incident — but prompt veterinary care can potentially prevent or treat some of these complications. So, when you and your four-legged best friend head out this summer, remember these important tips for keeping dogs cool outside. And don’t forget to bring plenty of water and sunscreen for yourself!

not_monkey,"Cats enjoy eating a variety of foods that offer everything from protein to carbohydrate. If you’re getting ready to adopt a cat, you’re probably wondering what cats can eat. Read on to learn what you should feed your cat. Cats are obligate carnivores, in other words, meat eaters. “Cats really thrive when part of their diet comes from animal sources,” explains Purina Senior Nutritionist Jan Dempsey. Some protein-rich foods cats like to eat are: Cats need to eat protein. Unlike people and dogs, protein is the main energy source in cats’ diets. But that doesn’t mean cats can’t eat grains, vegetables, and fruits. Cats can eat all of these foods. Some are just easier for them to digest than others. Cats can digest and use nutrients from a variety of foods. Pet nutritionists know this and create recipes with cats’ needs in mind. The ingredients they select benefit cats, taste good and are easily digestible. Is your cat picky or is she bored? Cats can get bored at mealtime. And when your cat gets bored with her meals, she may begin to reject her food. But if you keep things interesting, she may be less picky. ""Cats generally like variety,” Dempsey explains. Owners can encourage that love of ""new"" by introducing new foods often. “An easy way cat owners can do this is feed a dry cat food that’s complete and balanced and feed a little bit of wet. Wet food tends to have a lot of variety of flavors,” Dempsey suggests. Some cats may like a feeding routine. But if your cat is overweight, set feeding times and amounts can help her lose weight. In general, cats are known to graze throughout the day. While you can do this with dry food, wet food isn’t safe to leave out all day, so serve it at a time when you can clean it up right away. There are a number of whole foods you can feed your cat. Just feed them like a treat. Some foods cats can eat include: What you should feed your cat depends on her needs. Purina provides a cat food selector that can help you make a decision based on your cat's age and lifestyle. Purina offers formulas designed for your cat's unique needs and products that fit within your lifestyle. We'll help you find the perfect match."
not_monkey,"There are many ways to prepare eggs. Once fully cooked, the protein in eggs can be good for cats. But will your cat eat eggs? That’s another matter. Keep reading to see how you can prepare eggs as a treat for your cat. Being carnivores, cats benefit from eggs’ protein and amino acids. But, if you do give your cat egg to eat, feed it as a treat. “Feed just a tiny amount because you don’t want to put too many calories in your cat’s diet,” Purina Senior Nutritionist Jan Dempsey explains. Not much. “It’s easy to overfeed a cat. They don’t need many calories a day, just 150-200 for a moderately active, 10-pound cat,” says Dempsey. The amount of egg your cat can eat should be no more than 10 percent of her daily calories, and because a whole egg is about 90 calories, the amount of egg you give her with should be very small. No, it isn't. Eggs are considered to be the gold standard in protein. For a single food, they are as close to being nutritionally complete as possible. So, the protein and amino acids in eggs are good for cats. But still an egg isn’t a perfect meal for her. Instead, cats need to eat complete and balanced food every day. No. Raw eggs are not good for cats. When eggs are not cooked, they can harbor bacteria like Salmonella. And raw egg whites can be bad for cats. “There’s a protein called avidin in them that can bind the essential vitamin biotin (also known as vitamin B7), so cats are unable to absorb it,” Dempsey explains. Over time, that can cause a vitamin deficiency. But giving your cat cooked egg to eat prevents all of these risks. Maybe. It depends on your cat. Cats are known for being both picky and adventurous in what they eat. Having a neophilic nature means most cats like variety in what they eat. To know for certain, see how your cat reacts to a small portion of cooked egg. If your cat tends to like eggs, try pet nutrition that includes egg as a featured ingredient, like Beyond Grain Free White Meat Chicken and Egg Recipe or Grain Free Ocean Whitefish and Egg Recipe. These recipes balance eggs with other ingredients so your cat gets a nutritionally complete meal every time she eats. Yes. Kittens can have eggs. But considering how few calories kittens need each day, there are much better foods to feed them. To be sure you’re giving a kitten the nutrition she needs as she grows, it’s best to buy food and treats made especially for this time in her life. Purina offers formulas designed for your cat's unique needs and products that fit within your lifestyle. We'll help you find the perfect match."
not_monkey," SLIP! Slop! Slap! As public-health campaigns go, Cancer Council Australia’s dancing seagull telling people to slip on a shirt, slop on some sunscreen and slap on a hat must rank among the stickiest in history. Launched in 1981, it prompted many a devoted sun worshipper to reconsider whether a “healthy tan” was virtuous, or a herald of premature skin ageing and cancer. It seems to have been effective: after increasing in the general population for decades, rates of the deadliest form of skin cancer, melanoma, are now falling among Australians under the age of 40. “These are people who will have been exposed to the [Slip, Slop, Slap] message for pretty much their whole lives,” says Heather Walker of Cancer Council Australia.
                     
 But has this come at a cost? In Australia and worldwide, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is increasing – and sunscreen has taken much of the blame. Low levels of vitamin D are associated with weaker bones and teeth, infections, cardiovascular disease and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis. And although vitamin D supplements have been touted as a solution, so far they don’t seem to have the effect that was expected. Now evidence is accumulating that sun exposure has benefits beyond vitamin D. All of this has prompted some to label sunscreen “the new margarine” – a reference to health advice in the 1980s and 90s to switch from butter to hydrogenated vegetable oil to protect heart health, only to discover that the trans-fats found in many margarines were potentially more …"
not_monkey," THE bacteria in our gut are vital to our health, but urbanisation and antibiotics mean that the rich diversity of the traditional human microbiome is being lost. Eric Alm wants to change this. A biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he has set up the non-profit Global Microbiome Conservancy. The aim is to collect stool samples from indigenous and isolated peoples and build a repository of their intestinal inhabitants before they disappear. Why create a library of gut bacteria?
 
 A lot of the biodiversity that is being lost today is housed within humans – in our gut microbiomes – and it could disappear altogether as more people living traditional lifestyles adopt industrialised ways of life. The time to act is now. What we are doing is taking a snapshot of the biodiversity of human gut microbes on Earth today, and then preserving that for future generations so that we always have the biodiversity that co-evolved with us stored somewhere. How much does the gut microbiome differ from one person to the next? It depends where you look. Across industrialised nations, there are some regional differences but they are relatively small compared with the differences between an urban North American, say, and someone living a non-industrialised lifestyle elsewhere in the world. When we look at some non-industrialised populations, many organisms we find don’t exist in urban North Americans. Why do these differences matter?
